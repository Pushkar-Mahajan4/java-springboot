# Jobsearch Portal

---

Designed to make the job search process easier and more efficient, the portal offers a user-friendly interface that is both intuitive and modern.

With React JS as the front-end, the platform delivers a fast, responsive and dynamic user experience, allowing for quick and easy navigation through the platform's many features. The platform's clean and modern design makes it simple for users to find exactly what they are looking for, whether it be job postings, employer information, or job search tips.

In the backend, the portal is powered by Java Springboot, providing a robust and secure foundation for the platform's many features. Springboot's powerful architecture ensures that data is processed quickly and securely, and that the platform's features and functions are delivered smoothly and efficiently.

For Database I have used MongoDB as it provides me with a NOSQL Database and I can make use of search features powered by the query aggregation pipeline provided by MongoDB.
The search feature enables users to search job postings using keywords that are matched against the Job's description, technology, or the profile.
